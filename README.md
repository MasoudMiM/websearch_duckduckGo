DuckDuckGo AI Chat is a free beta feature that allows you to have anonymous conversations with 3rd-party AI chat models. It currently supports Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku, Mistral AI’s Mixtral 8x7B, OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini, and Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B (built with Llama). Each model relies on unique algorithms and data sets and will respond to your prompts differently. You can use DuckDuckGo AI Chat to get answers to questions, compose an email, summarize text, or just have an interesting conversation.
